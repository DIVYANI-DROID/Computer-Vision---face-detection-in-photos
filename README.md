# Introduction

This repo was a personal learning experiment. The attempt was to allow someone to train a neural network over their personal photo collection in order to do face detection on the people in those photos. They could then organize the photos by those people into automatic groups.
This problem was characterized by small labeled training sets, as we only want to ask the user to identify a few of the users to train the net. An individual trained photo model would also be kept private and not shared between photo users for privacy reasons, which can make training more challenging.
